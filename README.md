# Contract Model #

This repository provides an interface to
[quickcheck-dynamic](https://github.com/input-output-hk/quickcheck-dynamic/)
for developers of Plutus scripts. The main purpose of this repository is to offer
an alternative to testing Plutus scripts with quickcheck via the
[plutus-apps](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/) repository.
If you use the plutus-apps repository for development of your scripts, we refer to the
[tutorials](https://plutus-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plutus/tutorials/contract-models.html).
You do not need this repository, it is a dependency of plutus-apps.

## Automatic test case generation ##

Like any quickcheck library, this repository provides you with the means of automatically generated
test cases for your Plutus scripts. It generates those test caes from a specification or model of
the contract. This contract model has to be provided by a developer. This model describes for each
action that creates a transaction what the behaviour of that action is on the contract state. It
is very similar to the models provided in this
[tutorial](https://plutus-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plutus/tutorials/contract-models.html).

If you want to be independent of plutus-apps, use your own way and languages designing Plutus scripts, then this
repository offers a blockchain specific interface on top of quickcheck-dynamic. The contract model has a uniform way to
describe wallets. There are standard properties that quickcheck tests for. The models provide automatic shrinking of
failing test cases, such that your debug effort is minimized.

## Actions and Transactions ##

The contract model describes the actions users can perform with your contract. Many of these actions will result in the
generation of a transaction that is then posted to the blockchain. However, you can also add actions to the model to
wait a certain number of blocks or to put funds or tokens into a wallet not involving the plutus script under test.  The
actions described in the model have to be connected to the world in which you write your contract via the interface of a
`perform` function. Think of it like you write your actions abstract in the model world, like `Pay` and `Redeem`,
whereas you build your transactions via some code that comes up with the actual transaction that you have written as
part of your contract API. If that API is Haskell, then the effort to write the `perform` function is rather limited.
However, if you have written it in a different language, you need to bridge between Haskell and that language.

You have to provide an interface between the abstract operations in the contract model and the off-chain code in your
project that creates the actual transactions.

## Blockchain Emulation ##

In order to test your contract, the transactions you create are posted to a blockchain emulator. You can use any
emulator you fancy as long as it is Cardano.API compatible. You could even use the test-net, but be aware that this can
be very slow if you run hundreds of transactions in your tests. The API you need to implement talking to your emulator
of choice is documented in [EmulatorAPI.md](EmulatorAPI.md].

## Coverage data ##

When quickcheck runs your property, it collect on-chain coverage data.
https://plutus-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plutus/tutorials/contract-models.html#measuring-coverage-of-on-chain-code.
That is, it collects statistics which part of the validators are used during testing, but most importantly, which
validator parts are never used during testing. If certain parts of the validator are never triggered during testing,
then testing may not be through enough.

We use the standard plutus compiler to insert coverage tags in the on-chain code. If you do not use the plutus compiler
and still want to collect on-chain validator coverage information, you’ll need to add those in a different way.

## Standard properties ##

There are standard properties for checking that your contract cannot get in a state in which funds are locked and nobody
can get those funds out. You can re-use those properties.  You can add your own additional unit tests, if so required.

(Something about double satisfaction and threat models later)

## Certification ##

When you have thoroughly tested your contract and want to show for your users how well you did, you can connect your
results to the certification service that IOG offers.
